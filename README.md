Bad Chip8 Emulator made in rust

To learn more about Rust and programming in general I tried to make a Chip8 emulator. Changing the rom used or the amount of ticks per frame requires you to edit the main file as I haven't implemented any sort of command line functionality. 
The emulator also doesn't have working sound because I couldn't figure out how to get that working with SDL3. 
It does seem to be functional though so that's good I guess.
